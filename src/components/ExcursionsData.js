			"Refresh yourself with a ride on the most ancient Thai transportation on the river, bamboo rafts. Be attentive to your paddler boy, he might show you wild animals that sleep along the river above you on the tree branches as snakes, monkeys, spiders, monitor lizards etc. The tour continues to the military area, where the turtles are protected and taking care of before being released into the wild. Free time to relax close to a refreshing waterfall and have delicious Thai lunch.",
